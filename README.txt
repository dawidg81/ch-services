Hello.

This repository contains important files dedicated for an nginx server
to handle basic services of MineCraft, ClassiCube and ClassicHate, including
storing accounts and their info and a server list.

For now there are only 3 files that handle a server list.
Make sure you have nginx server software installed.
Here is what to do to make this work:
1. Put heartbeat.php and servers.php in html/ directory,
2. Put nginx.conf in conf/ directory (replace the old one).

Currently in development.
